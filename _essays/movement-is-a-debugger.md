  system: Nightbind session-state bug
  issue: race condition reproduces only under focused staring, not under test
  constraint: fix ships tomorrow; no time for a full repro harness

Movement is a debugger. The walk that solves the bug is not a break from work — it is a mode switch your brain needs to see the edge you are stuck on.

I proved this on a Nightbind session-state bug that survived three hours at the desk. The race reproduced in production, not in tests, and every hypothesis I wrote down in the chair sounded plausible and was wrong. Twenty minutes into a walk — no phone, no podcast — I remembered the guard we skipped on the transition from *idle* to *submitting*. Not inspiration. Diffuse attention doing what focused attention could not: surfacing a file I had not opened in two days.[^1]

They treat exercise as time stolen from output. The accounting is backwards. Cortisol drops, blood flow rises, and the brain stops rehearsing the same wrong trace. Insights cluster in diffuse mode because you finally stop forcing the same synapse.

When you are circling the same log line for an hour, stop. Move on purpose. Come back with a pen.
