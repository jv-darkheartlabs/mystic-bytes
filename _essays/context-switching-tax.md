## Thesis

Every interruption carries a visible cost — the minute you spent in chat — and a hidden cost in destroyed deep-work state that teams almost never itemize on a ledger.

## Context

On a Nightbind feature crew we prided ourselves on responsiveness. Median Slack first-response time was under three minutes. Sprint velocity on paper looked fine. Carryover climbed anyway — stories that should have been two days became five, always with plausible excuses: dependency, scope creep, "unexpected complexity."

The complexity was often context. I tracked my own work for two weeks: each "quick question" cost not one minute but twenty-three on average before I recovered the same mental stack — open files, half-written test, the hypothesis I was about to falsify. Multiply by six engineers and a quarter and the line item dwarfed the standup where we wondered why estimates lie.

## Mechanism

**Attention is not fungible.** Gloria Mark's research at UC Irvine documents recovery time after interruptions — often more than twenty minutes to return to the same depth of focus, longer when the interrupted task was cognitively demanding.[^1] The Slack reply in two minutes is paid by an engineer who will not ship the thing they were holding in working memory. Teams measure responsiveness because it is easy to see. They do not measure reconstruction time because it happens inside skulls.

**Context is state, and state is expensive.** A debugger stopped on the right breakpoint, a failing test reproducing the edge case, a SQL query half-tuned — these are warm caches. Interruption flushes them. Cal Newport calls deep work the scarce resource knowledge economies compete for; constant partial attention is the default that burns it.[^2] Responsiveness culture optimizes the wrong variable: latency of reply over throughput of finished work.

**The tax is regressive.** Senior engineers pay more per interruption because their tasks require larger loaded context — architecture, cross-service traces, subtle race conditions. Juniors pay differently — more frequent interrupts because they ask and are asked. AuDHD contributors and others with executive-function variance often pay steepest: rebuilding context after a ping is not a minor annoyance but a full re-orientation. The team that celebrates always-on availability is running a regressive tax on its most expensive cognition.

**Meetings are context switches with calendar RSVP.** A thirty-minute slot mid-morning splits a four-hour deep block into two fragments too small for hard problems. Teams stack fragments and wonder why afternoons fill with "easy" tickets. The fix is structural: batch synchronous obligations, defend morning or afternoon focus blocks, default to async for anything that does not require real-time negotiation.

**Itemizing the tax makes it political.** Once you estimate reconstruction minutes per interrupt, responsiveness stops looking free. On mystic-bytes pipeline work we adopted team norms: `[async]` prefix means no same-day reply expected; focus blocks on calendar are real meetings with self; urgent means production down, not "I am blocked on a preference." Throughput improved without headcount.

**Leaders set the interrupt rate.** When a staff engineer responds to every `@here` in seconds, the org learns that depth is optional. I batch Slack at four pm on writing days and say so in status. The first week felt rude. The second week two juniors admitted they had copied the pattern and finished their first hard tickets in months. Permission is structural when it comes from the top of the interrupt chain.

## Tradeoffs

**Responsiveness vs throughput.** Customer-facing on-call requires fast paging; feature work does not require fast Slack. Split channels and expectations instead of one norm for everything.

**Collaboration vs isolation.** Deep work blocks can feel antisocial. Pairing and scheduled office hours recover collaboration without ambient interruptibility.

**Manager visibility vs maker schedule.** Managers live in interrupts; makers do not. Asymmetric schedules need explicit contract — "I will read at 4pm" is not slacking; it is batching.

**When interruptibility is correct.** Incidents, launches, and genuine pair-debugging sessions justify breaking focus. The test is frequency and reversibility — not whether any sync ever happens.

Treat deep work as the default and interruptions as withdrawals that require justification. Protect the block the way you protect a deploy window — because both are when the real work ships. Async-first is not laziness; it is honest accounting of a tax your spreadsheet never showed you.
