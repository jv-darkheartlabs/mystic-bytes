brief:
  system: Twitch ingest and transcoding stack
  issue: '"bitrate looks fine" but viewers buffer every peak hour'
  constraint: no new hardware; justify a config change with numbers that survive review

Mathematics is not a club for the credentialed. It is a notation for thinking carefully about things too slippery to hold in English.

I needed this debugging the darkheartlabs ingest stack. Peak-hour buffering felt like a CDN problem until I wrote the actual inequality: concurrent viewers × average bitrate against egress headroom, with a fifteen-percent rebuffer tax. Prose said "we are probably fine." The inequality said we were three gigabits short on Saturday nights. The fix was a config change, not a new box — but only because the symbols made the gap legible.[^1]

Engineers who avoid math do not avoid the underlying difficulty. They pay in vague reasoning, lucky intuitions, and back-of-envelope estimates that turn out to be order-of-magnitude wrong. Symbols are scaffolding. They break when the load is wrong, which is earlier than production.

Reach for math the way you reach for a debugger: when the situation has stopped being legible in words.
