The LLM hallucinates. That is not a defect in the traditional sense — it is the mechanism. The model emits the most plausible next token, and plausibility is a different property than truth.

I watched this up close generating mystic-bytes reading entries. Ask for a pub year on a niche romantasy title and you get a confident 2019 — wrong by three years, formatted perfectly. The output was useless as fact and useful as draft: it forced me to check the source, and the fluent summary still saved twenty minutes of blank-page friction. The failure mode is not fabrication. The failure mode is treating fabrication as citation.[^1]

They optimize for helpful tone, not epistemic hygiene. A confident wrong answer can shake loose a right one in your head. A fluent rephrase can reach the thought you could not quite phrase. None of that makes the model an oracle.

Treat every claim as a draft that needs a source. Treat every draft as the opening move in a longer conversation you still own.
