The half-life of technical knowledge in this field is short. The framework that paid your rent in 2018 is a museum piece by 2026. Traditional apprenticeship — master teaches apprentice the stack — decays before the apprenticeship ends.

## Thesis

**Mentor the slow layer: judgment, taste, and how to show up.** Tools turn over; the ability to read a system, weigh a tradeoff, and recover from being wrong in public compounds across every stack a person will ever touch.

## Context

A contributor joined me on the mystic-bytes reading pipeline — Node scripts, Postgres manifests, vision rename passes, the usual glue. Week two they asked the honest question: *Should I learn React Server Components or go deep on the import scripts first?* The honest answer: the import scripts will still be here in six months; RSC may not be how we ship the site by then. But the scripts are also the wrong thing to worship. The durable lesson is how to trace data through a pipeline, write a reversible change, and document the contract for the next person.

I have watched mentorship fail when it became framework tourism — a senior engineer performing expertise through toolchain recall. The mentee learns where buttons are. They do not learn what to do when the buttons move.

## Mechanism

**Two layers of skill:**

1. **Fast layer** — syntax, APIs, framework idioms. High decay rate. Necessary for shipping this quarter.
2. **Slow layer** — systems reading, risk assessment, communication, epistemic humility. Low decay rate. Determines whether the fast layer is applied wisely.

Andy Grove framed the manager's job as output through others; in technical mentorship the multiplier is judgment transferred, not keystrokes copied.[^1] The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition — novice to expert — shows that experts rely on pattern recognition across cases, not rules memorized in isolation.[^2] You cannot Dreyfus someone by handing them docs. You give them progressively ambiguous problems and stay present while they misread one safely.

**What I try to teach on the slow layer:**

- **Read before write** — map inputs, outputs, owners, and failure modes before opening the editor.
- **Name the tradeoff** — every choice has a cost; say it aloud in the PR.
- **Write for the absent maintainer** — comments and commit messages are mentorship letters.
- **Disagree without cruelty** — call a bad idea bad; do not call a person stupid.
- **End meetings** — bandwidth is finite; leaving on time is senior behavior.

**Frameworks still matter — as coursework, not identity.** I pair on the actual stack. I also say explicitly: *this is the fast layer.* When Next.js or the vision CLI changes, the habit of tracing slugs through manifests remains.

On Nightbind I mentored a contributor through a payment edge-case fix not by dictating the patch but by drawing the state diagram together — the same discipline as the checkout modal essay. They shipped the fix and kept the diagram habit when the payment provider changed fields three months later.

**Mentorship scales poorly; design for residue.** Office hours, review culture, incident postmortems assigned as reading, shadowing on one real incident — these leave artifacts. One-to-one heroics do not scale; documented judgment does.

## Tradeoffs

**Depth on current stack vs breadth on principles.** Shipping requires stack depth. Careers require principles. A good mentorship quarter does both: one real feature on the current tools, one explicit retro on what would survive a rewrite.

**Time now vs autonomy later.** Hovering prevents mistakes; it also prevents learning. The goal is a shorter hover each week, not permanent pairing.

**When the industry speed helps.** Fast churn forces beginners to learn how to learn — docs, source, debugging — instead of settling into one vendor's gospel. Frame the chaos as practice, not betrayal.

**When mentorship is not enough.** Toxic intake, no psychological safety, no time budget — no mentor fixes a broken system. See the burnout essay: environment eats individual coaching for breakfast.

Teach the next person what you would need if every framework disappeared tonight: how to read the system, name the risk, write the note, and say "I do not know yet" without shame. The tools will rotate. That posture is what makes them worth hiring after the rotation.
