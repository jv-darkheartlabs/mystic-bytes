Burnout is rarely a personal failure. It is a systems failure that organizations file under personal failure because personal failure is cheaper to administrate than structural change.

## Thesis

When output collapses after sustained over-utilization, the correct postmortem target is the **work system** — intake, pacing, recognition, safety — not the contributor's resilience.

## Context

I have watched five engineers burn out across three organizations in the last decade. The plot is stable: a high-output contributor inherits work that scales faster than headcount; they ship; intake increases; somewhere between months nine and fourteen, throughput drops, cynicism rises, and they leave or take medical leave. Leadership frames it as disengagement. The utilization graph, if anyone pulled it, would show a resource run at 120% until failure — the same curve as an oversubscribed database.[^1]

Christina Maslach's burnout research separates **exhaustion**, **cynicism**, and **reduced efficacy** as occupational phenomena driven by workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values — not character defects.[^2] When those variables skew wrong for long enough, the person breaks in predictable ways.

## Mechanism

**Wellness programs as downstream patches.** Meditation stipends and resilience training are not harmful; they are often substitutes for upstream fixes — reducing WIP, renegotiating dates, staffing to sustained pace. Organizations buy sandbags because moving the river is politically expensive.

**The outage you do not page.** In ops, a service that fails three times in a quarter triggers a blameless postmortem. In people systems, three departures in eighteen months triggers performance improvement plans. The asymmetry is the bug. If the same team keeps producing burnout, the team is the incident.

**Variables managers control:**

- **Load** — honest accounting of sustainable hours, not heroics as baseline.
- **Autonomy** — low autonomy at high load is the fastest path to cynicism in Maslach's model.
- **Recognition** — not stock; explicit acknowledgment that the work was hard.
- **Predictability** — week-to-week surprise is a tax on executive function.
- **Safety to signal** — if "how are you" is performative, overload stays invisible until exit.

**AuDHD contributors as canary.** Sensory load, ambiguous briefs, and meeting-heavy cultures cost more when your nervous system and executive function are already under tax. Designing for that edge — optional meetings, written decisions, quieter async defaults — improves the median. The accommodation is an affordance.

**Silence as expensive debt.** Most cases I have seen had weeks of private awareness before public collapse. Silence persisted because honesty was career-coded as weakness. A 1:1 that always returns "fine" is not a feedback channel; it is theatre.

Managers owe written escalation when load exceeds capacity, customer-visible date slips instead of invisible overtime, and belief on the first overload signal — not the third. If a project requires sustained overtime to hit a committed date, that fact belongs in writing to leadership and, when appropriate, to the customer — not only in the bodies of the people doing the work.

Contributors owe early, written naming when gauges drift — sleep, irritability, loss of interest in problems they used to chase — to a manager who has earned trust. Individual boundaries help; they do not replace fixing intake. If no manager has earned that trust, the problem outgrows this essay: the environment is unsafe by design.

## Tradeoffs

**Reduce load vs renegotiate roadmap.** Cutting scope costs political capital with upstream stakeholders. It is still cheaper than rehiring and re-onboarding a senior engineer you trained for a year.

**Individual coping vs systemic fix.** Contributors should monitor sleep, boundaries, and early signals — but framing burnout as self-care alone lets the org off the hook for intake it controls.

**When "push through" is valid.** Crunch with a defined end date, shared sacrifice, and post-ship recovery can work. Crunch as permanent operating mode is extraction, not sprint.

The orgs that retained people through hard seasons shared one trait: they treated capacity as a budget with a ledger, not a virtue test. They said no in writing. They celebrated shipping without automatically doubling the next assignment. That is boring management. It is also how you keep the engineers who remember where the bodies are buried.

Treat recurring burnout like recurring outages: stop blaming the on-call human, instrument the intake system, fix the architecture, write the runbook so the next rotation does not relearn it in tears.
