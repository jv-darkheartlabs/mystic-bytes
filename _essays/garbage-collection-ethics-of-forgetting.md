Forgetting is not moral failure in a system — it is maintenance with an ethics problem when you get the retention schedule wrong.

Garbage collectors free unreachable memory so living references can breathe. Organizations run the same loop poorly: they retain every log, draft, and notification because deletion feels like loss, then wonder why search is slow and incidents hide in noise. I prune the mystic-bytes reading pipeline on a schedule — stale crops, orphan manifests, superseded vision tags — not because the data has no value, but because retained references become obligations. At scale, obligation is latency and liability.[^1]

The ethical line is not "delete everything." It is naming what must survive for audit, what may decay, and who pays when you keep too much for too long.

Design TTLs for data the way you design them for caches. Review what you are still holding because deleting would require admitting you no longer need it.
