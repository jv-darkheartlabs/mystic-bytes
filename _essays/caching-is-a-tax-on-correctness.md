A cache trades latency for consistency. You are not buying speed — you are accepting a bounded lie and betting you know exactly when that lie expires.

I learned this again running the mystic-bytes cover pipeline: a corrected manifest entry still rendered the old image because the CDN edge and the local preprocess cache each had a different notion of "current." Nothing was wrong with Redis or the object store. The team — me, at 11pm — had never written down which layer owned invalidation when a slug changed but the filename did not.[^1]

Most cache incidents look like implementation bugs and are actually contract bugs. The cache did what caches do: returned the last answer it was allowed to keep. The system failed because nobody had named the staleness budget out loud — how wrong the UI may be, for how long, under which events.

Document the contract before you tune TTLs. If you cannot explain when the cache is permitted to lie, you are not ready to add one.
